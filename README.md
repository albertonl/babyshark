# Contributing

Contributions are most welcome! Feel free to bring your wisdom and leave your mark in the history of science that will be remembered for many years to come.

Contributors are encouraged to create new implementations and translations of the song in any language as long as it can be represented in a computer and stored in this repository. Modifications and corrections of existing implementations are also accepted, provided that they identify an issue with the existing code and are actively trying to resolve it.

All implementations are expected to follow a series of basic rules to maintain the integrity of the project:

1. The translation or implementation of the song must adhere strictly to the lyrics at the top of this document.
   1. In the case of natural language translations, slight modifications are allowed given that they maintain the overall meaning of the verse or sentence, i.e. it doesn't need to be a word-by-word literal translation.
   2. In the case of programming language implementations, the lyrics of the song must be in English and should be presented using the standard output whenever possible, with each verse being in a separate line. For example:
      ```
      Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo
      Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo
      Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo
      Baby shark!
      ...
      ```
2. All files should be named `babyshark`, followed by the proper file extension, depending on the implementation.
3. Natural language translations must be written in Markdown format, and the extension to be used is `.[language code].md`, where `[language code]` is the code of the language in the ISO 639-1 or, preferably, ISO 639-2 or [ISO 639-3](https://iso639-3.sil.org/) standard (e.g. `babyshark.en.md` or `babyshark.eng.md` for English).
4. Markdown files with natural language translations should include the title of the song ('Baby Shark') translated to the language at hand, and nothing else but the translation of the lyrics. Verses **must be separated by an empty line**, even between stanzas, to ensure each verse is correctly rendered in a different line. As an example we can see an extract of the Spanish translation:
   ```markdown
   # Bebé tiburón

   Bebé tiburón, doo doo doo doo doo doo

   Bebé tiburón, doo doo doo doo doo doo

   Bebé tiburón, doo doo doo doo doo doo

   ¡Bebé tiburón!

   Mamá tiburón, doo doo doo doo doo doo

   ...
   ```
5. To represent the 'doo' sounds, phonetical transliterations such as 'du', 'ду' or 'डू' are encouraged if the spelling 'doo' is not valid or does not convey the same pronunciation in your language, although for languages using the Latin script, the usage of 'doo' is allowed.
6. Contributors must list themselves and their implementation(s) in the tables above by modifying this document upon submitting a pull request.

## Ideas

If you are not sure where to start, here are some ideas of languages that people still fear to tackle:

- Brainfuck
- Messiscript
- COBOL
- Polish
